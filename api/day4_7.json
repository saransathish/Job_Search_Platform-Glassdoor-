This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengalaru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.\n    \n\n\n<h2>Pay and benefits</h2>\n<p>Stripe does not yet include pay ranges in job postings in every country. Stripe strongly values pay transparency and is working toward pay transparency globally.</p>\n<h2>We look forward to hearing from you</h2>\n\n\n      At Stripe, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>About the team:</strong></h3>\n<p>Verification &amp; Identity Platform (VIP) is a core platform team which powers user onboarding &amp; verification (KYC &amp; KYB) worldwide &amp; ensures continued compliance throughout the merchant life-cycle at Stripe. Our team safeguards user identities across our array of digital services, designing and executing a secure, effortless, and user-centered identity collection &amp; verification environment. Our efforts cover a broad spectrum of identity confirming scenarios, including identity proofing, risk-based, and adaptive verification technology. We provide a in-house smart orchestration eco system which allows us to integrate with multiple 3P data verification services, financial institutions and regulatory bodies to build accuracy, reliability and speed to verify accounts &amp; businesses. We enable Stripe's continued compliance in an ever-evolving regulatory landscape by providing infrastructure that automates document collection, verification &amp; merchant communication for high scale requirements refresh and accounts remediation programs.</p>\n<h2><strong>You will:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams</span></li>\n<li><span>Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack</span></li>\n<li><span>Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale</span></li>\n<li><span>Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Who you are</strong></h2>\n<p><span>It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.</span></p>\n<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>You have a strong technical background with 4-10 years of technical experience building APIs.</span></li>\n<li><span>Think about systems and services and write high quality code. </span></li>\n<li><span>Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems.</span></li>\n<li><span>Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.</span></li>\n<li><span>Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.</span></li>\n<li><span>Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Preferred qualifications</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span> Domain expertise in accounting or financial management is a plus but not at all a requirement</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In-office expectations</h2>\n\n\n      Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengalaru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.\n    \n\n\n<h2>Pay and benefits</h2>\n<p>Stripe does not yet include pay ranges in job postings in every country. Stripe strongly values pay transparency and is working toward pay transparency globally.</p>\n<h2>We look forward to hearing from you</h2>\n\n\n      At Stripe, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Stripe, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.",
